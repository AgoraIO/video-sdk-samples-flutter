# Audio and voice effects

Video SDK makes it simple for you to publish audio captured through the microphone to subscribers in a channel. In some cases, users want to modify the captured audio to add sound effects, mix in a pre-recorded audio, or change the voice quality before the audio is published. Video SDK provides several options that enable you to add sound effects, mix in pre-recorded audio, apply voice effects and set the audio route. This page shows you how to implement these features in your channel.

This sample project shows you how to:

- Set an audio profile and scenario
- Implement audio effects and audio mixing
- Apply voice effects
- Set the audio route
